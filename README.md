### Hi there 👋

My name is Samuel Martineau, 
architectural technologist from Quebec/Canada.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the DynALisp repository alongside my day to day AutoCAD projects.
- 🌱 Actively growing my Autolisp knowledge.
- 👀 Looking at C#/python and the related Autodesk API for some futur projects.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on any AEC projects that can make our day to day workflow better.
- 📫 How to reach me: DynALisp Discord server for now... as my main email is overflow with garbage mail 😏
